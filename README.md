# ALACPD
## Memory-free Online Change-point Detection: A Novel Neural Network Approach

ALACPD exploits an LSTM-autoencoder-based neural network to perform unsupervised online CPD; it continuously adapts to the incoming samples without keeping the previously received input, thus being memory-free. 

### Usage
To run the code with the desired specifications you can use "run.sbatch" file.
