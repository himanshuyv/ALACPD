# ALACPD
## Memory-free Online Change-point Detection: A Novel Neural Network Approach

ALACPD exploits an LSTM-autoencoder-based neural network to perform unsupervised online CPD; it continuously adapts to the incoming samples without keeping the previously received input, thus being memory-free. 

### Usage
To run the code with the desired specifications you can use "run.sbatch" file.

### Datasets
To evaluate our model, we have used datasets offered by [Turing Change Point Dataset](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TCPD).


### Acknowledgements
We have used [LSTNet](https://github.com/fbadine/LSTNet) and [OED](https://github.com/tungk/OED).
